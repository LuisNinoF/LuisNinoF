Over the past 5+ years, I have worked on designing and testing industrial machinery and consumer products. Most recently, I positioned myself as a specialist in the field of sensors in an electronics and software department. 

## Objective

I’m currently expanding my software expertise by programming ARM microcontrollers to create smart products. I am now eager to transition to the field of embedded systems and IoT as a firmware engineer.
